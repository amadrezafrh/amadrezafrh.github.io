I want to create a github personal portfolio website using github pages. I'm an ML engineer. You are allowed to create any additional files needed. Let's keep it simple, navifating toward proejcts, mentioning skills in appropriate places when writing projects. We have a folder named 'projects' in the root directory where we include projects done (wait for instructions about each project). 

It is crucial NOT USING ANY EMOJIES. It is important to proceed with very small steps while desigining. I want your outputs in the chat be minimum as possible, just write the code or instructions needed and with very small details in the chat.
